# Note Formatter
I made this ruby script during the development of my final project at UFF - Universidade Federal Fluminense. I needed to format the quick notes that we took during our meetings into a more complete txt file. 

This script formats a plain txt with some markups into a txt which describes the date, location, duration, attendees and tasks we discussed in the meetings.
